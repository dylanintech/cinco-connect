# Welcome to Cinco Connect üòÅ

## What is this?

Cinco Connect is a minimalist, easy-to-use app that allows users to stay up-to-date with everything *Cinco Ranch High School*.

## What stack did I use?

I used `React Native` and `Expo` to build Cinco Connect. I chose this stack because I've shipped a lot of web apps - so I'm used to `React` - and it's been a long time since I learned `Swift`. I hope you enjoy using Cinco Connect! If you have any feedback my Twitter DMs are open & this app is open source, so you can make a PR any time!
